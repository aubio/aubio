Python aubio module
===================

This module wraps the aubio library for Python using the numpy module.

Before compiling this module, you must have compiled libaubio.

For more information about how this module works, please refer to the [Python/C
API Reference Manual] (http://docs.python.org/c-api/index.html) and the
[Numpy/C API Reference](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/c-api.html).

Compiling python aubio
----------------------

After libaubio has been build successfully, and provided Python development
headers and numpy can be found on your system, you should be able to build the
aubio Python module:

    $ ./setup.py build

To find out more about `setup.py` options:

    $ ./setup.py --help

Installing
----------

To install the Python module:

    $ ./setup.py install

Using the Python module
-----------------------

Once the aubio library and the Python module are installed, you will be able to
import the aubio module:

    $ python
    [...]
    >>> import aubio
    >>>

Alternatively, you may want to use the Python module without installing it by
setting PYTHONPATH:

    $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD/`ls -rtd build/lib.* | head -1`:$PWD/tests

Similarly, you can use the aubio module without installing libaubio by pointing
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the path libaubio can be found at:

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:PWD/../build/src

Or on Mac OS X systems, setting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:

    $ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PWD/../build/src

Testing the Python module
-------------------------

Once both the C library and the Python module have been built correctly, and
after you have installed them (or setting the environment variable correctly),
you should be able to run the tests:

    $ ./tests/run_all_tests

And to try out the demos:

    $ ./demos/demo_source.wav /path/to/sound/sample.wav

You need to install additional modules to run some of the demos. For
instance, several demos use [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) to draw plots.
Some more demos use [PySoundCard](https://github.com/bastibe/PySoundCard) to
play and record sounds.
