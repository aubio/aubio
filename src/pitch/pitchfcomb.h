   Pitch detection using a fast harmonic comb filter

   This pitch extraction method implements a fast harmonic comb filter to
   determine the fundamental frequency of a harmonic sound.

   This file was derived from the tuneit project, written by Mario Lang to
   detect the fundamental frequency of a sound.

   See http://delysid.org/tuneit.html
