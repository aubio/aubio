  Pitch detection using a spectral implementation of the YIN algorithm

  This algorithm was derived from the YIN algorithm. In this implementation, a
  Fourier transform is used to compute a tapered square difference function,
  which allows spectral weighting. Because the difference function is tapered,
  the selection of the period is simplified.
