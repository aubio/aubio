  Pitch detection using multiple-comb filter

  This fundamental frequency estimation algorithm implements spectral
  flattening, multi-comb filtering and peak histogramming.

  This method was designed by Juan P. Bello and described in:

  Juan-Pablo Bello. ``Towards the Automated Analysis of Simple Polyphonic
  Music''.  PhD thesis, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of
  London, London, UK, 2003.
