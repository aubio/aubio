   Pitch detection using a Schmitt trigger

   This pitch extraction method implements a Schmitt trigger to estimate the
   period of a signal.

   This file was derived from the tuneit project, written by Mario Lang to
   detect the fundamental frequency of a sound.

   See http://delysid.org/tuneit.html
