  Pitch detection object

  This file creates the objects required for the computation of the selected
  pitch detection algorithm and output the results, in midi note or Hz.

  \section pitch Pitch detection methods

  A list of the pitch detection methods currently available follows.

  \b \p default : use the default method

  Currently, the default method is set to \p yinfft .

  \b \p schmitt : Schmitt trigger

  This pitch extraction method implements a Schmitt trigger to estimate the
  period of a signal.

  This file was derived from the tuneit project, written by Mario Lang to
  detect the fundamental frequency of a sound.

  See http://delysid.org/tuneit.html

  \b \p fcomb : a fast harmonic comb filter

  This pitch extraction method implements a fast harmonic comb filter to
  determine the fundamental frequency of a harmonic sound.

  This file was derived from the tuneit project, written by Mario Lang to
  detect the fundamental frequency of a sound.

  See http://delysid.org/tuneit.html

  \b \p mcomb : multiple-comb filter

  This fundamental frequency estimation algorithm implements spectral
  flattening, multi-comb filtering and peak histogramming.

  This method was designed by Juan P. Bello and described in:

  Juan-Pablo Bello. ``Towards the Automated Analysis of Simple Polyphonic
  Music''.  PhD thesis, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of
  London, London, UK, 2003.

  \b \p yin : YIN algorithm

  This algorithm was developed by A. de Cheveigne and H. Kawahara and
  published in:

  De Cheveign√©, A., Kawahara, H. (2002) "YIN, a fundamental frequency
  estimator for speech and music", J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 111, 1917-1930.

  see http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/pcm/pub/people/cheveign.html

  \b \p yinfast : Yinfast algorithm

  This algorithm is equivalent to the YIN algorithm, but computed in the
  spectral domain for efficiency. See also `python/demos/demo_yin_compare.py`.

  \b \p yinfft : Yinfft algorithm

  This algorithm was derived from the YIN algorithm. In this implementation, a
  Fourier transform is used to compute a tapered square difference function,
  which allows spectral weighting. Because the difference function is tapered,
  the selection of the period is simplified.

  systems](http://aubio.org/phd/), Chapter 3, Pitch Analysis, PhD thesis,
  Centre for Digital music, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK, 2006.

  \b \p specacf : Pitch detection using spectral auto correlation

  This algorithm implements pitch detection by computing the autocorrelation
  function as the cosine transform of the square spectral magnitudes.

  periodicity estimation algorithms. In Proceedings of the European Signal
  Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), 2000.
