  Spectral description functions

  All of the following spectral description functions take as arguments the FFT
  of a windowed signal (as created with aubio_pvoc). They output one smpl_t per
  buffer (stored in a vector of size [1]).

  \section specdesc Spectral description functions

  A list of the spectral description methods currently available follows.

  \subsection onsetdesc Onset detection functions

  These functions are designed to raise at notes attacks in music signals.

  \b \p energy : Energy based onset detection function

  This function calculates the local energy of the input spectral frame.

  \b \p hfc : High Frequency Content onset detection function

  This method computes the High Frequency Content (HFC) of the input spectral
  frame. The resulting function is efficient at detecting percussive onsets.

  Musical Signal. PhD dissertation, University of Bristol, UK, 1996.

  \b \p complex : Complex Domain Method onset detection function

  Christopher Duxbury, Mike E. Davies, and Mark B. Sandler. Complex domain
  onset detection for musical signals. In Proceedings of the Digital Audio
  Effects Conference, DAFx-03, pages 90-93, London, UK, 2003.

  \b \p phase : Phase Based Method onset detection function

  detection for music signals. In Proceedings of the IEEE International
  Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing, pages 441­444,
  Hong-Kong, 2003.

  \b \p wphase : Weighted Phase Deviation onset detection function

  Conference on Digital Audio Ef- fects (DAFx) , pages 133–137, 2006.

  rhythm analysis. In IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo
  (ICME 2001), pages 881­884, Tokyo, Japan, August 2001.

  \b \p kl : Kullback-Liebler onset detection function

  signals. In Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference
  (ICMC), Singapore, 2003.

  \b \p mkl : Modified Kullback-Liebler onset detection function

  Paul Brossier, ``Automatic annotation of musical audio for interactive
  systems'', Chapter 2, Temporal segmentation, PhD thesis, Centre for Digital
  music, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK, 2006.

  \b \p specflux : Spectral Flux

  International Conference on Digital Audio Effects'' (DAFx-06), Montreal,
  Canada, 2006.

  \subsection shapedesc Spectral shape descriptors

  The following descriptors are described in:

  Geoffroy Peeters, <i>A large set of audio features for sound description
  (similarity and classification) in the CUIDADO project</i>, CUIDADO I.S.T.
  Project Report 2004 (<a
  href="http://www.ircam.fr/anasyn/peeters/ARTICLES/Peeters_2003_cuidadoaudiofeatures.pdf">pdf</a>)

  \b \p centroid : Spectral centroid

  The spectral centroid represents the barycenter of the spectrum.

  \e Note: This function returns the result in bin. To get the spectral
  centroid in Hz, aubio_bintofreq() should be used.

  \b \p spread : Spectral spread

  The spectral spread is the variance of the spectral distribution around its
  centroid.

  See also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">Standard
  deviation</a> on Wikipedia.

  \b \p skewness : Spectral skewness

  Similarly, the skewness is computed from the third order moment of the
  spectrum. A negative skewness indicates more energy on the lower part of the
  spectrum. A positive skewness indicates more energy on the high frequency of
  the spectrum.

  See also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness">Skewness</a> on
  Wikipedia.

  \b \p kurtosis : Spectral kurtosis

  The kurtosis is a measure of the flatness of the spectrum, computed from the
  fourth order moment.

  See also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis">Kurtosis</a> on
  Wikipedia.

  \b \p slope : Spectral slope

  The spectral slope represents decreasing rate of the spectral amplitude,
  computed using a linear regression.

  \b \p decrease : Spectral decrease

  The spectral decrease is another representation of the decreasing rate,
  based on perceptual criteria.

  \b \p rolloff : Spectral roll-off

  This function returns the bin number below which 95% of the spectrum energy
  is found.
