/** \file

  Media source to read blocks of consecutive audio samples from file.

  To write to file, use ::aubio_sink_t.

  Depending on how aubio was compiled, the following sources will be available.

  When creating a new source using ::new_aubio_source, the new function of each
  of the compiled-in sources will be used, in the following order, until one of
  them gets successfully created. If all sources returned NULL,
  ::new_aubio_source will return NULL.

  \b \p source_avcodec : libav

  aubio can be optionally compiled with [libav](http://libav.org), which can
  read from a very large number of audio and video formats, including over
  different network protocols such as HTTP.

  \b \p source_apple_audio : ExtAudioFileRef

  On Mac and iOS platforms, aubio should be compiled with CoreAudio [Extended
  Audio File Services]
  (https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MusicAudio/Reference/ExtendedAudioFileServicesReference/Reference/reference.html).
  This provides access to most common audio file formats, including compressed
  ones.

  \b \p source_sndfile : libsndfile

  Also optional, aubio can be built against
  [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/), which can read [most
  uncompressed formats](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Features).

  \b \p source_wavread : native WAV reader

  A simple source to read from 16-bits PCM RIFF encoded WAV files.

  \example io/test-source.c
  \example io/test-source_multi.c
