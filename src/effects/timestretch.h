  time stretching object

  ::aubio_timestretch_t can be used to open a source file, read samples from
  it, time-stretch them, and write out the modified samples.

  The time-stretching factor can be changed at any time using
  aubio_timestretch_set_stretch().

  A transposition can also be applied and changed at any time with
  aubio_timestretch_set_transpose().

  \example effects/test-timestretch.c
