/** \file

  Second order Infinite Impulse Response filter

  This file implements a normalised biquad filter (second order IIR):

  \f$ y[n] = b_0 x[n] + b_1 x[n-1] + b_2 x[n-2] - a_1 y[n-1] - a_2 y[n-2] \f$

  The filtfilt version runs the filter twice, forward and backward, to
  compensate the phase shifting of the forward operation.

  See also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter">Digital
  biquad filter</a> on wikipedia.

  \example temporal/test-biquad.c
