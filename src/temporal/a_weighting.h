  A-weighting filter coefficients

  This file creates an A-weighting digital filter, which reduces low and high
  frequencies and enhance the middle ones to reflect the ability of the human
  hearing.

  The implementation is based on the following standard:

    - IEC/CD 1672: Electroacoustics-Sound Level Meters, IEC, Geneva, Nov.  1996,
  for A- and C-weighting filters.

  See also:

    - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-weighting">A-Weighting on
  Wikipedia</a>
    - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighting_filter">Weighting filter on
  Wikipedia</a>
    - <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69">Christophe
  Couvreur's 'octave' toolbox</a>

  The coefficients in this file have been computed using Christophe Couvreur's
  scripts in octave 3.0 (debian package 1:3.0.5-6+b2 with octave-signal
  1.0.9-1+b1 on i386), with <pre> [b, a] = adsign(1/Fs) </pre> for various
  sampling frequencies (8000, 11025, 16000, 22050, 24000, 32000, 44100, 48000,
  88200, 96000, and 192000 Hz).

  The sampling frequency should normally be higher than 20kHz, but most common
  file sampling rates have been included for completeness.
