  Digital filter

  This object stores a digital filter of order \f$n\f$.
  It contains the following data:
    - \f$ n*1 b_i \f$ feedforward coefficients
    - \f$ n*1 a_i \f$ feedback coefficients
    - \f$ n*c x_i \f$ input signal
    - \f$ n*c y_i \f$ output signal

  For convenience, the samplerate of the input signal is also stored in the
  object.

  Feedforward and feedback parameters can be modified using
  aubio_filter_get_feedback() and aubio_filter_get_feedforward().

  The function aubio_filter_do_outplace() computes the following output signal
  \f$ y[n] \f$ from the input signal \f$ x[n] \f$:

  \f{eqnarray*}{
     y[n] = b_0 x[n] & + & b_1 x[n-1] + b_2 x[n-2] + ... + b_P x[n-P] \\
                     & - & a_1 y[n-1] - a_2 y[n-2] - ... - a_P y[n-P] \\
  \f}

  The function aubio_filter_do() executes the same computation but modifies
  directly the input signal (in-place).

  The function aubio_filter_do_filtfilt() version runs the filter twice, first
  forward then backward, to compensate with the phase shifting of the forward
  operation.

  Some convenience functions are provided:
    - new_aubio_filter_a_weighting() and aubio_filter_set_a_weighting(),
    - new_aubio_filter_c_weighting() and aubio_filter_set_c_weighting().
    - new_aubio_filter_biquad() and aubio_filter_set_biquad().
