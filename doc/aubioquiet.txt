NAME
  aubioquiet - a command line tool to extracts quiet and loud regions from a file

SYNOPSIS

  aubioquiet source
  aubioquiet [[-i] source]
             [-r rate] [-B win] [-H hop]
             [-T time-format]
             [-s sil]
             [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

  aubioquiet will print a timestamp each time it detects a new silent region or
  a new loud region in a sound file.

  When started with an input source (-i/--input), the detected timestamps are
  printed on the console, in seconds.

OPTIONS

  This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
  starting with two dashes (--). A summary of options is included below.

  -i, --input source  Run analysis on this audio file. Most uncompressed and
  compressed are supported, depending on how aubio was built.

  -r, --samplerate rate  Fetch the input source, resampled at the given
  sampling rate. The rate should be specified in Hertz as an integer. If 0,
  the sampling rate of the original source will be used. Defaults to 0.

  -B, --bufsize win  The size of the buffer to analyze, that is the length
  of the window used for spectral and temporal computations. Defaults to 512.

  -H, --hopsize hop  The number of samples between two consecutive analysis.
  Defaults to 256.

  -s, --silence sil  Set the silence threshold, in dB, under which the pitch
  will not be detected. Defaults to -90.0.

  -T, --timeformat format  Set time format (samples, ms, seconds). Defaults to
  seconds.

  -h, --help  Print a short help message and exit.

  -v, --verbose  Be verbose.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT

  NOISY: 28.775330

  QUIET: 28.914648
