Command line tools
==================

The python module comes with the following tools:

 - ``aubio`` estimate and extract descriptors from sound files
 - ``aubiocut`` slices sound files at onset or beat timestamps

More command line tools are included along with the library.

 - ``aubioonset`` outputs the time stamp of detected note onsets
 - ``aubiopitch`` attempts to identify a fundamental frequency, or pitch, for
   each frame of the input sound
 - ``aubiolevel`` outputs audio sound pressure level (volume) information, for
   each frame of the input sound
 - ``aubiomfcc`` computes Mel-frequency Cepstrum Coefficients
 - ``aubiotrack`` outputs the time stamp of detected beats
 - ``aubionotes`` emits midi-like notes, with an onset, a pitch, and a duration
 - ``aubioquiet`` extracts quiet and loud regions
