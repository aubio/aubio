NAME
  aubiotrack - a command line tool to extract musical beats from audio signals

SYNOPSIS

  aubiotrack source
  aubiotrack [[-i] source] [-o sink]
             [-r rate] [-B win] [-H hop]
             [-T time-format]
             [-s sil] [-m]
             [-j] [-N miditap-note] [-V miditap-velo]
             [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

  aubiotrack attempts to detect beats, the time where one would intuitively be
  tapping his foot.

  When started with an input source (-i/--input), the detected beats are given
  on the console, in seconds.

  When started without an input source, or with the jack option (-j/--jack),
  aubiotrack starts in jack mode.

OPTIONS

  This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
  starting with two dashes (--). A summary of options is included below.

  -i, --input source  Run analysis on this audio file. Most uncompressed and
  compressed are supported, depending on how aubio was built.

  -o, --output sink  Save results in this file. The file will be created on the
  model of the input file. Beats are marked by a short wood-block like sound.

  -r, --samplerate rate  Fetch the input source, resampled at the given
  sampling rate. The rate should be specified in Hertz as an integer. If 0,
  the sampling rate of the original source will be used. Defaults to 0.

  -B, --bufsize win  The size of the buffer to analyze, that is the length
  of the window used for spectral and temporal computations. Defaults to 512.

  -H, --hopsize hop  The number of samples between two consecutive analysis.
  Defaults to 256.

  -s, --silence sil  Set the silence threshold, in dB, under which the pitch
  will not be detected. A value of -20.0 would eliminate most onsets but the
  loudest ones. A value of -90.0 would select all onsets. Defaults to -90.0.

  -m, --mix-input  Mix source signal to the output signal before writing to
  sink.

  -f, --force-overwrite  Overwrite output file if it already exists.

  -j, --jack  Use Jack input/output. You will need a Jack connection
  controller to feed aubio some signal and listen to its output.

  -N, --miditap-note  Override note value for MIDI tap. Defaults to 69.

  -V, --miditap-velop  Override velocity value for MIDI tap. Defaults to 65.

  -T, --timeformat format  Set time format (samples, ms, seconds). Defaults to
  seconds.

  -h, --help  Print a short help message and exit.

  -v, --verbose  Be verbose.

BEAT TRACKING METHODS

  Aubio currently implements one the causal beat tracking algorithm designed by
  Matthew Davies and described in the following articles:

  (ISMIR), pages 164Â­169, Barcelona, Spain, 2004.
