NAME
  aubiolevel - a command line tool to extract audio sound pressure level

SYNOPSIS

  aubiolevel source
  aubiolevel [[-i] source]
             [-r rate] [-B win] [-H hop]
             [-T time-format]
             [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

  aubiolevel outputs audio sound pressure level information.

  The sound pressure level is printed on the console, prefixed by a timestamp
  in seconds. The level is in dB SPL, which is ten times the log10 of the
  average of the square amplitudes.

  The sound pressure level is either a negative number, or negative infinity
  (printed as -inf) when there is no sound.

OPTIONS

  This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
  starting with two dashes (--). A summary of options is included below.

  -i, --input source  Run analysis on this audio file. Most uncompressed and
  compressed are supported, depending on how aubio was built.

  -r, --samplerate rate  Fetch the input source, resampled at the given
  sampling rate. The rate should be specified in Hertz as an integer. If 0,
  the sampling rate of the original source will be used. Defaults to 0.

  -B, --bufsize win  The size of the buffer to analyze, that is the length
  of the window used for spectral and temporal computations. Defaults to 2048.

  -H, --hopsize hop  The number of samples between two consecutive analysis.
  Defaults to 256.

  -T, --timeformat format  Set time format (samples, ms, seconds). Defaults to
  seconds.

  -h, --help  Print a short help message and exit.

  -v, --verbose  Be verbose.
