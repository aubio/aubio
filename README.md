aubio is a library to label music and sounds. It listens to audio signals and
attempts to detect events. For instance, when a drum is hit, at which frequency
is a note, or at what tempo is a rhythmic melody.

Its features include segmenting a sound file before each of its attacks,
performing pitch detection, tapping the beat and producing midi streams from
live audio.

aubio provide several algorithms and routines, including:

  - several onset detection methods
  - different pitch detection methods
  - tempo tracking and beat detection
  - MFCC (mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients)
  - FFT and phase vocoder
  - up/down-sampling
  - digital filters (low pass, high pass, and more)
  - spectral filtering
  - transient/steady-state separation
  - sound file read and write access
  - various mathematics utilities for music applications

The name aubio comes from _audio_ with a typo: some errors are likely to be
found in the results.

Python module
-------------

A python module for aubio is provided. For more information on how to use it,
please see the file [`python/README.md`](python/README.md) and the
[manual](https://aubio.org/manual/latest/) .

Tools
-----

The python module comes with the following command line tools:

 - `aubio` extracts informations from sound files
 - `aubiocut` slices sound files at onset or beat timestamps

Additional command line tools are included along with the library:

 - `aubioonset` outputs the time stamp of detected note onsets
 - `aubiopitch` attempts to identify a fundamental frequency, or pitch, for
   each frame of the input sound
 - `aubiolevel` outputs audio sound pressure level (volume) information, for
   each frame of the input sound
 - `aubiomfcc` computes Mel-frequency Cepstrum Coefficients
 - `aubiotrack` outputs the time stamp of detected beats
 - `aubionotes` emits midi-like notes, with an onset, a pitch, and a duration
 - `aubioquiet` extracts quiet and loud regions
